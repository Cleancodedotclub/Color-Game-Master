JavaScript Color Game Master is a repository that provides a game application that tests users' ability to recognize different colors. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and includes several difficulty levels.

The repository includes a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that provide the foundation for the color game. The HTML files include the basic structure for the game board and user interface, while the CSS files provide the styling and layout of the game. The JavaScript files contain the logic and algorithms for generating random colors, selecting correct answers, and keeping track of scores.

Users can play the game by visiting the website and selecting a difficulty level. The game board displays a set of colored squares, and the user is prompted to select the correct color based on a given RGB value. The game is timed, and scores are displayed at the end of each round.

Developers can also customize the game by modifying the JavaScript code or adding new features. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels.
